# Woven Monopoly - Comprehensive Implementation Guide

## Project Background

### Objective
Develop a deterministic Monopoly-style board game simulation that demonstrates software design principles, game logic implementation, and algorithmic thinking.

## System Architecture

### Components
1. **Player Class**
   - Manages individual player state
   - Tracks critical attributes:
     * Name
     * Current position
     * Money balance
     * Owned properties

2. **MonopolyGame Class**
   - Coordinates game mechanics
   - Handles:
     * Player turns
     * Dice rolling
     * Property transactions
     * Win condition evaluation

### Game Mechanics Implemented

#### Turn Progression
- Fixed player order: Peter → Billy → Charlotte → Sweedal
- Deterministic dice rolls
- Automatic movement and property acquisition

#### Key Rules
- Starting money: $16
- Board wrapping
- Mandatory property purchase
- $1 bonus for passing GO
- Winner determined by maximum money

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Structures
- **Players**: List-based management
- **Board**: JSON-configured
- **Dice Rolls**: Predefined sequences

### Core Functions

#### `move()` Method
- Circular board navigation
- Uses modulo operation for position calculation
- Ensures seamless board traversal

#### `buy_property()` Method
- Validates player's financial capability
- Automatically purchases available properties
- Updates player's money and property portfolio

#### `collect_money()` Method
- Simple monetary transaction mechanism
- Logs financial events

## Configuration Management

### Board Configuration (`board.json`)
- Flexible property definition
- Supports multiple property types
- Extensible structure

### Dice Roll Scenarios
- Predefined rolls in `rolls_1.json` and `rolls_2.json`
- Enables reproducible game simulations

## Design Principles Applied
